# Calculator

## Introduction
This  simple calculator project is the part of the Odin Project curriculum (Dec 2024). After learning foundation of front End Development , we had to create this project to test our knowledge. At this stage we have learnt foundational HTML, foundational CSS , In JS about data types and their most useful method except symbols. I tried to implement conventional commit, and good practices for comments in code. With more knowledge the code for the program will be written more accurately. Thanks for reading.
